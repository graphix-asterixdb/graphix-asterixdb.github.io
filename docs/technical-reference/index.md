# Technical Reference

This technical reference is intended to give insight into _how_ Graphix plans and executes its queries.
Similar to the language reference, the technical reference is not intended to discuss how AsterixDB (and consequently Algebricks and Hyracks) operates, but rather how Graphix works in tandem with the aforementioned pieces.
