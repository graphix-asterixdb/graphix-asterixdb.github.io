## Reserved Field Names
During compilation, Graphix must attach graph-specific schema information to each vertex and edge body.
As a consequence, the field name `_GraphixSchemaDetail` is reserved by Graphix and an error will be raised if a conflict is found.

## Reserved Keywords
The following keywords are reserved by both Graphix and SQL++, and cannot be used as unescaped identifiers.
The keywords in bold are keywords introduced by Graphix:
